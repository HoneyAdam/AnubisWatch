## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Comprehensive configuration validation for all config types
- Soul configuration validation with protocol-specific checks
- Channel configuration validation (webhook, slack, telegram, email, etc.)
- Alert rule validation with condition type checking

### Changed
- Refactored `cmd/anubis/main.go` into smaller command-group files (`backup.go`, `cluster.go`, `judge.go`, `soul.go`, `system.go`, `util.go`)
- Moved server-specific adapters and helpers from `main.go` into `server.go`
- Enhanced `validate()` to automatically call `setDefaults()` before validation
