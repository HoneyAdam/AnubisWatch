## 3. Problem Statement

### Section Title
# Your Monitoring Stack is a Graveyard

### Intro
Most monitoring tools were built for a different era. They're slow, complex, and require a PhD to deploy. You deserve better.

### Problem Cards

#### 🪦 Too Many Dependencies
**"npm install 847 packages"**
Node.js monitoring tools that need more RAM than your app. Python tools that break on every update. Java tools that need their own data center.

#### 🪦 Complex Deployments
**"Kubernetes, Helm, Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager..."**
What started as simple uptime checks became a DevOps project. Your monitoring stack needs monitoring.

#### 🪦 Limited Protocols
**"HTTP and... that's it?"**
Your infrastructure speaks DNS, gRPC, WebSocket, SMTP. Your monitoring tool speaks only HTTP.

#### 🪦 Cloud-Only
**"SaaS subscription: $49/month"**
Great until you need self-hosted. Then you're locked in. Or you pay enterprise pricing.

#### 🪦 No Cluster Support
**"Single point of failure"**
Your monitor dies, you don't know your site is down until users complain. Irony: your uptime tool has no uptime.

## 4. Solution / Features

### Section Title
# One Binary to Judge Them All

### Intro
AnubisWatch is written in Go 1.26 with zero external dependencies. The React 19 dashboard is compiled into the binary. What you get is a single executable that does one thing: weigh your uptime, forever.

### Feature Grid

#### ⚡ Single Binary
No Node.js, no Python, no Java. One statically-linked Go binary that runs anywhere. ARM, x86, Raspberry Pi, Kubernetes — if it runs Linux, it runs AnubisWatch.

#### 🎛️ Embedded Dashboard
Beautiful React 19 dashboard compiled into the binary. No separate frontend deployment. No CORS nightmares. No `npm install`. Just `anubis serve`.

#### 🌐 Eight Protocols
HTTP, TCP, UDP, DNS, SMTP, ICMP, gRPC, WebSocket, TLS. If your infrastructure speaks it, AnubisWatch can judge it.

#### 🔗 Raft Consensus
Built-in distributed clustering. Every node is a probe and a controller. Automatic leader election. Self-healing. The Necropolis never sleeps.

#### 💾 CobaltDB Storage
Embedded B+Tree database with encryption at rest. No external database. No migrations. Time-series compaction built in.

#### 📊 Synthetic Monitoring
Multi-step user journeys with variable extraction. Test your login flow, checkout process, or API workflows. Duat Journeys go where simple checks can't.

#### 🎭 Multi-Tenant
SaaS-ready workspace isolation. Run one instance for your entire company. Each team gets their own souls, alerts, and dashboards.

#### 🤖 MCP-Native
AI agent integration out of the box. Ask Claude, Cursor, or your MCP client: "What's the status of production?" AnubisWatch responds.

## 5. Protocol Support

### Section Title
# Eight Protocols. One Judge.

### Protocol Cards

| Protocol | Use Case | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **HTTP/HTTPS** | REST APIs, webhooks, health endpoints | `GET /health` → 200 OK |
| **TCP** | Database ports, custom services | PostgreSQL :5432 banner |
| **UDP** | DNS, game servers, streaming | Query response validation |
| **DNS** | Domain resolution, propagation | A, AAAA, MX, TXT records |
| **SMTP/IMAP** | Email server health | STARTTLS, AUTH, mailbox |
| **ICMP** | Network latency, packet loss | Ping with jitter analysis |
| **gRPC** | Microservices health | HealthCheckingProtocol |
| **WebSocket** | Real-time connections | graphql-ws handshake |
| **TLS** | Certificate monitoring | Expiry, chain, OCSP |

## 6. Architecture

### Section Title
# The Necropolis Architecture

### Diagram Description
Animated diagram showing:
1. **3 Jackal Nodes** (Raft cluster) with leader election
2. **Check Distribution** — Leader assigns souls to jackals
3. **Judgment Flow** — Each jackal probes targets
4. **Verdict Storage** — Results written to CobaltDB
5. **Alert Dispatch** — Triggers fire to channels
6. **Dashboard** — Real-time Hall of Ma'at view

### How It Works

#### Step 1: Cluster Formation
Nodes discover each other via mDNS (LAN), gossip (WAN), or manual seeds. Raft elects a Pharaoh (leader).

#### Step 2: Check Distribution
The Pharaoh distributes souls (monitors) across jackals (nodes). Strategies: round-robin, region-aware, latency-optimized.

#### Step 3: Continuous Judgment
Each jackal probes assigned targets. Results replicated via Raft log. Leader handles API writes, followers handle reads.

#### Step 4: Verdict & Alert
Judgments trigger verdicts (alerts) based on rules. Cooldowns prevent spam. Escalation policies page on-call.

#### Step 5: Dashboard & Status
Hall of Ma'at (dashboard) shows real-time health. Book of the Dead (status page) shows public uptime.

## Tone Guidelines

- **Authoritative:** Speak with confidence. "Your server is dead." not "Your server might be experiencing issues."
- **Ancient Wisdom:** Use Egyptian mythology terms consistently. Reference the Duat, Ma'at, Ammit.
- **Dark Humor:** Alerts can say "devoured by Ammit." But keep it professional.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Show code. Respect the reader's intelligence. No marketing fluff.
